\b0 \cf2 Text: Hafiz\
Music: Mukhtor Muborakqadamov (composed in 2000)\
Vocal solo: Aqnazar Alovatov\
Mukhtor Muborakqadamov, who plays set\'e2r in the Badakhshan Ensemble, set this\
well-known poem of Hafiz to a melody that he composed himself. \'93It\'92s popular\
among both old and young people in Khoroq,\'94 said Mukhtor. \'93Young people here\
read Hafiz. They study his poetry in school, and also read him on their own. Older\
people know the text by heart. We perform the song a lot in our concerts and at\
weddings. You can accompany it with a synthesizer, but it\'92s better in a folk style.\'94\
(An elegant translation by Gertrude Bell of the full poem is reproduced in Hafiz: The\
Mystic Poets as \'93No Reproach for the Drunkard\'94)}
