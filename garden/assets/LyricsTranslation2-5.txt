\b0 \cf0 Come to the land of beauty and devotion, O Canaanite moon!\
Come, shining sun, I'm a vagrant pilgrim!\
Step into my hut out of generosity, like a healer,\
I'm afflicted by love, O, my beauty, you're the remedy of my pain, come!\
Since you left, you flower-gowned one, my hut's become home to sorrow,\
Come like the soul in to the land of the flesh, O, hidden moon, come!\
I became the diver in the sea of the heart, yet I failed to find pearls,\
My solitude becomes oppressive, O moon, even if you hide, come!\
