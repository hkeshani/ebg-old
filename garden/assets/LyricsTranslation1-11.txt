Gul (Flower)The hollyhock that appears in the springGrows like a flame day after day.When the nightingale sings in the spring,The flower is still more beautiful.The time comes for the flower to bloom,Spring is the time of flowers.You blossom like spring flowers.Spring is truly the time of the young.The nightingales cling to the flowers;They turned heads to exchange glances.The nightingale is like a dew on the flower.Truly we're worthy of this [happy] life.If a nightingale sings at dawn,It's like the aroma of a fine flower.Our spirits rise, and we open upIn this new time.
