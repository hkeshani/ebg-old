Sirojiddin Juraev, dutar\
\
This virtuosic composition for solo dutar shows off an unusual technique that involves simultaneously fretting and plucking the strings with the left hand while tapping the deck of the instrument lightly with the right hand to mark a beat. The two strings of the dutar are tuned in unison, rather than in the customary fourth or fifth. For aspiring dutar players of the Ferghana-\
Tashkent school, mastery of \'93Qushtar\'94 is considered de rigueur.}
