Aigul Ulkenbaeva, dombra\
\
Sholpan, the only daughter of the local nobleman, was being given in marriage. She was known as an outstanding dombra player, and many people admired her mastery. Sitting on the shymyldyk (special place for the bride, surrounded on all sides by expensive silks), Sholpan turned to her fellow aul-dwellers. \'93My dear friends, now the day of my wedding has come. Play me a new kui and let it become a farewell piece before our separation.\'94 Trying to outdo one another, a stream of dombra players performed their kuis, but not a single one touched the young bride\'92s heart. Frustrated, Sholpan exclaimed, \'93What a pity that no one can convey my emotions upon parting!\'94 At that moment, Mamen, until then unnoticed by the crowd, stood up and spoke to Sholpan: \'93Give me your dombra and I\'92ll perform a kui for you.\'94 The crowd laughed at the audacity of the unknown guest.\
\'93Listen, you impostor. What are you trying to do, make a fool of yourself so that we kick you out of the aul?\'94 \
Sholpan interrupted, \'93Let him show his art. But if you don\'92t like the kui, then do with him what you will,\'94 and with that, she gave Mamen her dombra. Mamen took the dombra and played an unknown kui. Amazed at his mastery and with great admiration for the kui, people asked, \'93Who are you, dear man?\'94; \'93I am Mamen.\'94; \'93So before us is the great kuishi Mamen from Kamys-Samara,\'94 exclaimed Sholpan, inviting him to come to the place of honor (tor). The kui that Mamen dedicated to Sholpan has become known as \'93Aqsholpan\'94 (lovely [literally \'93white\'94] Sholpan).\
