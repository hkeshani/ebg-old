MayeMaye is a generic compositional form that establishes the modal character of a mugham—its characteristic melodic motifs, tonal centers, principal intervals, typical melodic embellishments, and poles of melodic tension and resolution. Maye focuses on developing tonal relationships in the lowest octave register of a mugham, while subsequent sections gradually explore successively higher tonal regions.
