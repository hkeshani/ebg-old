I Burn, I Smoulder like Charcoal:I burn, I smoulder like charcoalI think I'm burning, but there is no smoke.On the upper part of my heartThere is no spot that is whole.In the high mountain pass Kan-JailooA cold breeze blows when snow falls.My dark-eyed one in the wide collar,I burn; if you know the price of my love,come yourself.Like a blossoming white poplarYou walk, showing off a white dress.I have no choice; I cannot be with youI wander around like a lost young camel.Like a blossoming silvery poplarYou walk so quiettishly in a silvery scarf.Unable to find a way to be with you,I am left suffering like a weeping young camel.
