Ay Pari (Oh Fairy) Oh fairy, flirtatious tyrant, how long will you torture me, my love?I am left without feathers or wings, how long will you torture me, my love? From the torment of longing for you,?I became a wandering dervish, how long will you torture me, my love? From your love, Qadir moans like a nightingale in the orchard I finished this tale, how long will you torture me, my love?
