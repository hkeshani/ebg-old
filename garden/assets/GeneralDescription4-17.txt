Noleydi (What if)Text: unattributed folksong, Ghazal by Seyyid Ezim Shirvani (1835–1888)Music: unattributedFargana Qasimova, vocal; accompanied by Rafael Asgarov, balaban; Rauf Islamov, kamancha; Ali Asgar Mammadov, tar; Natiq Shirinov, percussionThis two-part piece begins with a folk bayatı, a graceful seven-syllable verse form characteristic of Azerbaijani oral tradition. The last line transitions to the melodic style and rhythm of classicalmugham, where the singer’s improvised vocals lead the music in a new and emotionally more intense direction. The lyrics of the mugham are, as is traditional, a ghazal taken from classical written verse. Although the words of the two sections come from different sources, they are artfully combined: the folksong’s description of the beautiful gardens in the Miyina quarter of the city of Tabriz (Iran) foreshadows the paradisiacal rose garden (gülzar) of the ghazal.
