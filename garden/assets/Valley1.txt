1- The Valley of the QuestWhen you begin the Valley of the QuestMisfortunes will deprive you of all rest,Each moment some new trouble terrifies,And parrots there are panic-stricken flies.There years must vanish while you strive and grieve;There is the heart of all you will achieve –Renounce the world, your power and all you own,And in your heart’s blood journey on alone.When once your hands are empty, then your heartMust purify itself and move apartFrom everything that is – when this is done,The Lord’s light blazes brighter than the sun,Your heart is bathed in splendour and the questExpands a thousandfold within your breast.Though fire flares up across his path, and thoughA hundred monsters peer out from its glow,The pilgrim driven on by his desireWill like a moth rush gladly on the fire.When love inspires his heart he begs for wine,One drop to be vouchsafed him as a sign –And when he drinks this drop both worlds are gone;Dry-lipped he founders in oblivion.His zeal to know faith’s mysteries will makeHim fight with dragons for salvation’s sake –Though blasphemy and curses crowd the gate,Until it opens he will calmly wait,And then where is this faith? this blasphemy?Both vanish into strengthless vacancy.
