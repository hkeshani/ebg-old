Ay Pari (Oh Fairy) Text: QadiriMusic: Author unknown According to Soheba Davlatshoeva, “Ay Pari” was first performed in the 1950s?by the Pamir Ethnographic Ensemble, a Dushanbe-based state-sponsored group that composed, arranged, and performed many songs that remain popular in Badakhshan today. “Everyone sings ‘Ay Pari,’” said Soheba. “It’s performed in concerts, at weddings, and in theater productions. A well-known Tajik musician, Daler Nazar, turned it into a pop tune. We took our arrangement from other musicians who worked in the theater before us. The poet whose ghazal is used for the lyrics was a Badakhshani from Afghanistan, but none of us in the ensemble know when he lived.”
