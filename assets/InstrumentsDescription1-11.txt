KOMUZThe main folk instrument of the Kyrgyz is a three-stringed, fretless, long- necked lute, typically made from apricot wood, nut wood, or juniper. Playing techniques include plucking, strumming, and striking strings with the fingernails, as well as the use of stylized hand and arm gestures, which add an additional narrative component to the komuz' s typically programmatic repertory.
