\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl360\slmult1\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs24 \cf0 In this distinctively Afghan type of classical composition, sometimes known\
as naghma-ye chahartuk (four-part instrumental piece), or as lareh, Homayun and Toryalai\
interpret raga yaman. Yaman, an evening raga, has the scale: C-D-E-F#-G-A-B-C (in Indian\
sargam syllables: Sa-Re-Ge-Me-Pe-De-Ni-Sa). Such compositions are played as an overture to\
an evening\'92s vocal performance of ghazals, and are also favored as solo instrumental pieces\
for rub\'e2b, and for tanbur or dutar (Central Asian long-necked lutes).\
