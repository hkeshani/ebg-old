Khalfa-entertainers usually perform in groups of 3Ð4 under the direction of a head khalfa. In older song and dance traditions, khalfas performed only to the accompaniment of percussion instruments: a small frame drum (daf), a bracelet of small bells worn around the wrist of a dancer (zang), flat stone or metal clackers (qayraq), and plates held in each hand on which the khalfa tapped out a rhythm with thimbles worn on the fingers. During the 20th century, khalfa ensembles began adding a small button accordion (garmon), and nowadays, it has become an essential element of the khalfa sound.
