Shuhrat Razzaqov, dutar\
\
According to Uzbek dutar master Abdurahim Hamidov, \'93Torghay\'94 is the work of an unknown arranger who created the present variant of the piece for dutar from an earlier version sung by performers of epic poetry to the accompaniment of the Uzbek dombra, a small two-stringed lute (not to be confused with the larger Kazakh dombra). Such performers, called bakhshis, recite in a low, guttural timbre that calls to mind the \'93throat-singing\'94 of Tuvan and Mongolian pastoralists. Uzbek bakhshis use guttural timbre not only to recite epics but to imitate the sounds of birds\'97among them, the lark. The arranger of \'93Torghay\'94 transformed this vocal imitation into an instrumental piece. Shuhrat Razzaqov learned his dutar version of \'93Torghay\'94 from the playing of Zokirjon Obidov.\
